                    <h5>
                    Here i have created a flowchart design on
                    miro. I have started from the top with the home
                    page and gone throught each page with appropriate
                    links between pages. I have used various colours
                    to seperate the different type of pages. My website
                    has followed this design almost exactly and works as
                    i wanted it to.

                </h5>
         
            </div>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <div class="carp-container">
                <h5>
                    On the right are my wireframe designs for all of
                    my pages for my website. I have kept it fairly simple and
                    straight forward to navigate.
                    <p style="padding-top: 10px;"></p>
                    At the top of my page i have a title
                    and naviagtion menu.
                    I have arranged each page
                    a little different with some following
                    a row format
                    and others in a column.
                    <p style="padding-top: 10px;"></p>
                    Unlike my wireframe i have added more navigation
                    options to my top menu to make switching pages easier
                    and quicker. The only other change i made was the layout
                    of the second menu page for the ease of navigation
                </h5>

                    I have really enjoyed taking part in this project. In my past i have always enjoyed using code such
                    as python and delphi however never touched on HTML or CSS. This meant that the coding tasks came quite naturally to me and was the first task i completed. I found it very interesting how basic websites
                    can be made using html and seeing the extent that they can be styled using CSS. 
                    <p style="padding-top: 10px;"></p>
                    The design side of the course was all completely new to me, however still really enjoyable when
                    learning how to use InDesign and Illustrator. I picked up Illustrator really quickly and am very
                    happy with my typography designs. I feel that my CARP posters are my weakpoint as i was jumping into
                    it with no background knowledge except what i was taught in lectures. This made it difficult for me
                    to picture designs and apply them to InDesign. I would have liked to experiment with InDesign a bit
                    more as i did with Illustrator.
                    <p style="padding-top: 10px;"></p>
                    I planned my website to be very straight forward and minimilistic
                    to ensure its easy to use for any type of user. I have done this by creating multiple pages with
                    easy to use links and layouts. Users of my website
                    may include my lecturer (Mary) and other staff for marking and feedback, possible employers for
                    future
                    work as well as friends and family who are interested
                    in my work.
                    <p style="padding-top: 10px;"></p>
                    Although my website isn't perfect, it's the perfect basis for a more complex website that i could be
                    making in the future. Some tasks may not be to the standard that i wanted but i am still very
                    pleased with how my website has turned out.

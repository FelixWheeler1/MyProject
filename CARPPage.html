                <h3>Poster 1</h3>
            <img class="posters" src="CARP/Poster1.png"

            <h5>
            This was my first design and also first introduction
            into InDesign. I decided to go for a fairly simple yet
            still appealing design. The content is split up by an
            cartoon image of bristol. I have used a contrast in text size
            to ensure the reader see's the appropriate information first.
            <p style="margin-top: 15px ;"></p>
            The title is in a large and bold font to make it clear 
            what the poster is about. The date of the event is located at the top of the page 
            so it is easy to find. The repetition of balloons up the
            right hand side give depth affect to the poster and makes it stand out more.
            </h5>
           
        </div>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <div class="carp-container" style="margin-left:120px;">
            <h5>
For my second poster i have used a bilateral design to 
align the text. The text is aligned centrally with the
most important information decending from the top of the page.
I have broken up my backround image to give a bit of contrast
and proximity to my content. 
<p style="margin-top: 15px ;"></p>
Information about the festival is
vertically centered in a black box seperated from the logos
at the top and bottom of the page. Arranging the poster like
this makes it easier for the viewer to group together
content. 
<p style="margin-top: 15px ;"></p>
There is an orange colour scheme throughout my design.
I have repeated this by highlighting key words and using lines to
further break up the center content.
            </h5>
            <img class="posters" src="CARP/Poster2.png"
            style="margin-left: 130px;" >
            
          
          <h3 style="position: absolute;">Poster 2</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <div class="carp-container" style="margin-left: -120px;">
            <h3>Poster 3</h3>
            <img class="posters" src="CARP/Poster3.png"
            style="margin-right: 130px; margin-bottom: 40px;" >
             
        <h5>
            For my third design i have used a background image 
            of various hot air balloons on a sky blue gradient. I have placed my text around the ballons to make sure its still easily readable.
            <p style="margin-top: 15px ;"></p>
            Most text follows the same typeface and is aligned to the left, apart from 'free and accessable for everyone'. For this i have repeated and aligned the text centrally to ensure it stands out. 
            <p style="margin-top: 15px ;"></p>
            I split up the main title and used a different background image of Bristol to add a bit of character. I also scaled down te opacity of te image to create a bit of contrast to the main poster.

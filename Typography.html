                <h3>Axial Design</h3>
                <img src="Typography/AxialDesign.png" class="media">

                <h4>
             
                        Axial typography follows the principle that text is divided
                        by an imaginary line that follows an axis. In my design there is
                        a line on the diagonal axis with text on either side
                
                </h4>

                <h3>Bilateral Design</h3>
                <img src="Typography/BilateralDesign (1).png" class="media">
                <h4>
            
                        Similarly to axial designs, bilateral designs follow a line
                        however the text is arranged symmetrically on the line rather than divided by it.
                        In my design the text is arranged in the center with a black and white scheme to split up the
                        text and make it easier to read

                <h4>
               
                        Text in dilational designs is set alon circular paths to form
                        a curve around a common point. My design the text is formed in curves
                        , circuling around a point at the bottom of the design

                        Content is spread out or radiating from a central common center
                        and makes the text look like its 'coming toether'. In my design the text
                        is directed at a common point on the right-hand side
                        and seperated by a black and white scheme for easy viewing.

                <h4>
                 
                        Modular designs use repeating structures to break up and seperate
                        content. This can be with shapes or paragraphs for example.
                        My design involves text aligned to the left and right border
                        and is broken up using 3 simple lines making it easier to read.

                <h4>
               
                        Random designs follow no specific rules or patterns. It may
                        appear fractured and at off angles. In my design i have used a
                        variety of techniques, where no section of text is aligned. i have
                        arranged the text at different angles with different forms to create a random design.

                <h4>
               
                        Transitional designs have the idea that text will flow in a natural
                        way. It may look unorganised and can be shown with angles, shapes and text
                        My design uses curved lines to allow the text to
                        flow along the lines in a a natural way

                <h4>
                    <p>
Grid designs use horizontal and vertical lines as a
layout guide. This encourages consitency and makes it easier to relate
items. I have dones this by using bold white lines to seperate
the text in a grid format.
